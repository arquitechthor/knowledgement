# How to keep studying while traveling?

▶️ Be kind to yourself. Accept changes in your schedule.

▶️ Before you leave (travel) download the tools you will need (dictionary, flash card app, lessons, etc.).

▶️ Shift your focus. Focus on travel-friendly things (listening, reading, vocabulary with flashcards).

▶️ Share your learning. Teach others what you know.

▶️ Use the time for review (watch again lessons you already watched).
